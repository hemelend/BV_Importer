* [RubyOnRails] - is an open-source web framework thatâ€™s optimized for programmer happiness and sustainable productivity.
* [jQuery] - is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library.
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps.
* [MySQL] - is a powerful, open source object-relational database system.



### Installation

You need rbenv installed globally; first, if you have already installed any other ruby manager (like rvm), you must to get rid of rvm in order to install rbenv :

```sh
$ rvm implode
$ rm -rf .rvm
```
Ensure your homebrew is working properly and up to date
```sh
$ brew doctor
$ brew update
```
Install rbenv and ruby-build
```sh
$ brew install rbenv
$ brew install ruby-build
```
##Configurate working directory

### Global git ignore
```sh
$ git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore
$ printf "vendor/bundle\n.DS_Store\n" >> ~/.gitignore
```
## Set default bundle path
```sh
$ mkdir -p ~/.bundle
$ printf -- "---\nBUNDLE_PATH: vendor/bundle" >> ~/.bundle/config
```
## Instantiate rbenv with your shell (choose preferred file - .profile, .bash_profile, .zshrc, etc)
```sh
$ printf 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bash_profile
```
### Remove the RVM stuff from your .profile - It probably looks like...
[[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && . "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" # Load RVM function

## Reload your profile if you are using .profile
```sh
$ . ~/.profile
```

```sh
$ touch ~/.irbrc
$ printf "require 'irb/completion'" >> ~/.irbrc
```

```sh
$ rbenv install 2.2.0
$ rbenv rehash
```

```sh
$ brew install mysql
```
You can now start the database server using:
```sh
$ mysql.server restart
```
