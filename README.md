# BV_Importer
BeenVerified Test - Application to upload compressed (zip) CSV files with a simple interface to read, update, batch create, and batch delete marketing statistics data.

A user is be able to:
  - upload a compressed (zip) CSV file of data. Contents of the file should be mapped to the correct columns in the database (described below).
  - view a list of uploaded files
  - view the saved records from a file
  - delete all the records imported from a single file with one click
  - It is not be possible to duplicate a file upload

### Version
1.0.0

### Tech

BeenVerified Test uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [RubyOnRails] - is an open-source web framework thatâ€™s optimized for programmer happiness and sustainable productivity.
* [jQuery] - is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library.
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps.
* [MySQL] - is a powerful, open source object-relational database system.



# Installation

You need rbenv installed globally; first, if you have already installed any other ruby manager (like rvm), you must to get rid of rvm in order to install rbenv :

```sh
$ rvm implode
$ rm -rf .rvm
```
Ensure your homebrew is working properly and up to date
```sh
$ brew doctor
$ brew update
```
Install rbenv and ruby-build
```sh
$ brew install rbenv
$ brew install ruby-build
```
##Configurate working directory

### Global git ignore
```sh
$ git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore
$ printf "vendor/bundle\n.DS_Store\n" >> ~/.gitignore
```
### Set default bundle path
```sh
$ mkdir -p ~/.bundle
$ printf -- "---\nBUNDLE_PATH: vendor/bundle" >> ~/.bundle/config
```
### Instantiate rbenv with your shell (choose preferred file - .profile, .bash_profile, .zshrc, etc)
```sh
$ printf 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bash_profile
```
### Remove the RVM stuff from your .profile - It probably looks like...
[[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && . "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" # Load RVM function

### Reload your profile if you are using .profile
```sh
$ . ~/.profile
```

### Add autocompletion to IRB
```sh
$ touch ~/.irbrc
$ printf "require 'irb/completion'" >> ~/.irbrc
```

### Choose a ruby flavor version to install
```sh
$ rbenv install 2.2.0
$ rbenv rehash
```

### Install MySQL
```sh
$ brew install mysql
```
You can now start the database server using:
```sh
$ mysql.server restart
```

### Change to working dir and clone the source from github
```sh
$ git clone git@github.com/hemelend/BV_Importer.git
$ git fetch
$ git checkout master
```
### Change to application directory
```sh
$ rbenv local 2.2.0
```
### Bundle installation
```sh
$ gem install bundler
```
### Installing gems bundle
```sh
$ bundle install
```
### DBs creations steps
Run rake task to setup database
```sh
$ bundle exec rake db:setup
```

# Challenges, and how you overcame them
- Challenge: Read a compressed file witout save it in disk in order to improve the performance
  Solution: open the file and read the content into memory then create the csv object to upload the data
- Challenge: Create a batch/bulk upload for mass records
  Soluction: create an array with simple SQL command with all records then read the array in chunks of 1000 records and run
             the SQL Command to upload the data

# Reasoning behind any design decisions
- Used a free sample compressed csv file with 36k records, the file is about weather data so I mapped the file columns with database fields
  the fields are mapped as follow:
  * Campaign_name = policyID
  * impressions = concatenation of county, construction, line columns
  * clicks = point_granularity
  * cost = eq_site_limit
- The sample file is located in the root, and is called 'FL_insurance_sample.csv.zip'
- There are 3 tables called
  * Users: used to store user credentials, has many imported_files
  * Imported_files: used to store the file information, belongs to users and has many marketing_stats
  * Marketing_stats: used to store file data, belongs to imported_files
- The File is store into the application public folder

# Future improvements you would make with more time
- Right now it is using a minimalistic design; so, I would invest more time improving the look & feel
- For very big files (Millions of records), i would use a multi-thread process in order to improve the upload performance
